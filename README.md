# ducks ðŸ¦†

Provides Dex, a Python container for indexing objects of any type.

#### Install

```
pip install ducks
```

#### Usage

```
from ducks import Dex

objects = [{'x': 4, 'y': 1}, {'x': 6, 'y': 2}, {'x': 8, 'y': 5}]

# Create a Dex containing the dicts. Index on x and y.
dex = Dex(objects, ['x', 'y'])  

# find the ones you want
dex[{                           # find objects
    'x': {'>': 5, '<': 10},     # where x is between 5 and 10
    'y': {'in': [1, 2, 3]}      # and y is 1, 2, or 3
}]
# result: [{'x': 6, 'y': 2}]
```

Valid operators are ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, in, not in. 

#### Is Dex a database?

No. But like a database, Dex uses B-tree indexes and uses them to find results very quickly. It does
not any do other database things like SQL, tables, etc. This keeps Dex simple, light, and performant.

#### Is Dex fast?

Yes. Here's how Dex compares to other object-finders on an example task.

![Example benchmark](https://github.com/manimino/ducks/blob/main/examples/img/perf_bench.png)

[Benchmark code](https://github.com/manimino/ducks/blob/main/examples/perf_demo.ipynb)

The closest thing to a Dex is an in-memory SQLite. While SQLite is a fantastic database, it requires
more overhead. As such, Dex is generally faster.

### Class APIs

There are three containers.
 - Dex: Can `add`, `remove`, and `update` objects after creation.
[API]((https://ducks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ducks.mutable.html#ducks.mutable.main.Dex))
 - ConcurrentDex: Same as Dex, but thread-safe.
[API](https://ducks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ducks.concurrent.html#ducks.concurrent.main.ConcurrentDex)
 - FrozenDex: Cannot be changed after creation, it's read-only. But it's super fast, and of course thread-safe.
[API](https://ducks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ducks.frozen.html#ducks.frozen.main.FrozenDex)

All three can be pickled using the special functions `ducks.save(dex, file)` / `ducks.load(file)`. 


### Fancy Tricks

Expand for sample code.

<details>
<summary>Use functions of the object as attributes</summary>
<br />
You can also index on functions evaluated on the object, as if they were attributes.

Find palindromes of length 5 or 7:
```
from ducks import Dex
strings = ['bob', 'fives', 'kayak', 'stats', 'pullup', 'racecar']

# define a function that takes the object as input
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

dex = Dex(strings, [is_palindrome, len])
dex[{
    is_palindrome: True, 
    len: {'in': [5, 7]}
}]
# result: ['kayak', 'racecar', 'stats']
```

Functions are evaluated on the object when it is added to the Dex. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>Access nested data using functions</summary>
<br />
Use functions to get values from nested data structures.

```
from ducks import Dex

objs = [
    {'a': {'b': [1, 2, 3]}},
    {'a': {'b': [4, 5, 6]}}
]

def get_nested(obj):
    return obj['a']['b'][0]

dex = Dex(objs, [get_nested])
dex[{get_nested: 4}]
# result: {'a': {'b': [4, 5, 6]}}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Handle missing attributes</summary>
<br />

Objects don't need to have every attribute.

 - Objects that are missing an attribute will not be stored under that attribute. This saves lots of memory.
 - To find all objects that have an attribute, match the special value <code>ANY</code>. 
 - To find objects missing the attribute, exclude <code>ANY</code>.
 - In functions, raise <code>MissingAttribute</code> to tell Dex the object is missing.

Example:
```
from ducks import Dex, ANY
from ducks.exceptions import MissingAttribute

objs = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {}]

def get_a(obj):
    try:
        return obj['a']
    except KeyError:
        raise MissingAttribute  # tell Dex this attribute is missing

dex = Dex(objs, ['a', get_a])

dex[{'a': ANY}]          # result: [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}]
dex[{get_a: ANY}]        # result: [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}]
dex[{'a': {'!=': ANY}}]  # result: [{}]
```

Note that `None` is treated as a normal value and is stored.
</details>

Now you've got a ducks Dex of dicts. For lots more, [read the docs](https://ducks.readthedocs.io).
