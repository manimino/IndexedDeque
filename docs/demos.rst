These are mini-projects that demonstrate using ``ducks`` in applications.

* `Auto-updating <https://github.com/manimino/ducks/blob/main/examples/update.py>`_ - Keep Dex updated when objects change
* `Wordle solver <https://github.com/manimino/ducks/blob/main/examples/wordle.ipynb>`_ - Solve string matching problems faster than regex
* `Collision detection <https://github.com/manimino/ducks/blob/main/examples/collision.py>`_ - Find objects based on type and proximity (grid-based)
* `Percentiles <https://github.com/manimino/ducks/blob/main/examples/percentile.py>`_ - Find by percentile (median, p99, etc.)
